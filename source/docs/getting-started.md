# Getting Started

*THIS IS PRERELEASE SOFTWARE STILL UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENT!*  Expect occasional problems. If the program behaves badly,
please report an issue [here](https://github.com/danielskeenan/mobile_sacn/issues).

## Usage

1. Start the program. Select the network interfaces that will run the web UI
   and sACN.
    - If you're on a lighting network without WiFi, consider using the WiFi
      sharing feature built in to your operating system. The WiFi interface will
      handle the web UI and the wired interface will run sACN.
    - If your network has WiFi, select the same interface for both options.
2. Click "Start" and use your mobile device's camera to scan the QR code and
   open the web UI.
